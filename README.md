# Cups backend for SeedDMS

This is a cups backend to add SeedDMS as a printer. Printing to
a printer based on this backend will not physically print the
document but upload the printed file into SeedDMS.

On debian just install the .deb file with

    sudo dpkg -i printer-driver-seeddms_0.0.2-1_amd64.deb

When adding a new printer in cups you will be offered a local printer
called 'SeedDMS'. Choose a name, description, etc. and allow
network access if you like. When choosing a manufacturer, 
select 'Generic' and choose 'Generic SeedDMS Printer PDF'
as ppd file, which is the best choice in most cases.

Once the printer is added, you will need a configuration which sets
the location of your SeedDMS, the API key and the folder to upload
the printed file. Configuration files can be at several places (see
below). For simplicity, we assume a global configuration in
`/etc/seeddms-cups/printers.yaml`. If there is just one SeedDMS
printer, it will be sufficient to have a default section in your
configuration

    default:
      Url: http://your-seeddms-host/restapi/index.php
      ApiKey: your-secret-key
      FolderId: 1

If you have more SeedDMS printers replace `default` with the name
of the printer, in order to have different configurations.

Afterwards print your first file into SeedDMS (assuming your printer
is named `SeedDMS`)

    lp -d SeedDMS somefile.pdf

Though the printer is only available in your local network, but the
SeedDMS installation can be at any location accessible by http.

## How it work—ï internally

If you setup a printer in cups use the ppd file `seeddms-pdf.ppd`
shipped with this backend. It contains the line

    \*cupsFilter:    "application/vnd.cups-pdf 0 -"

which tells cups that application/vnd.cups-pdf can be send straight to
SeedDMS. Without that line cups expects SeedDMS to be a postscript
printer and runs the filter pdftops before passing the output to the
backend.  In that case `FINAL_CONTENT_TYPE` will be set to
application/vnd.cups-postscript and the backend will convert it back
to pdf. That would be a lot of unnecessary converting.

Adding the above filter will tell cups that the output of the initial
filter pdftopdf can be processes by the backend and no more conversion
is done.  In that case `FINAL_CONTENT_TYPE` is set to
application/vnd.cups-pdf which keeps the backend from running
ghostscript.

You could even replace all the filtering done by cups by setting

    \*cupsFilter2:   "image/png image/png 0 -"

(please note the '2')

This will override cupsFilter and even turn off the initial `pdftopdf`
filtering done by cups. A file of mime-type `image/png` will be uploaded
right away.  The disadvantage of this approach is, that you need
cupsFilter2 for each mime-type you intend to support. Another
disadvantage is, that `pdftopdf` does some useful page management
(rotation and selecting page ranges) which isn't done anymore, unless
the printing application does it itself (like web browsers do). The
PPD file `seeddms-passthru.ppd` sets `cupsFilter2` for `image/png`,
`image/jpeg`, `application/pdf` and `application\postscript`.

## Configuration

The path and the name of the configuration file has been changed in 0.0.2 for
more flexibility and a more common paths. The configuration file in the
user's home directory must be located in `.config/seeddms-cups/printers.yaml`
The system wide configuration must be in `/etc/seeddms-cups/printers.yaml`.
Additionally, the new path `/etc/seeddms-cups/<username>/printers.yaml`
will be checked for a configuration file. The precedence of the files is

1. User's home directory
2. `/etc/seeddms-cups/<username>/printers.yaml`
3. `/etc/seeddms-cups/printers.yaml`

Before version 0.0.2 the
backend read the configuration file `.seeddms-cups.yaml` from
either `/etc/seeddms-cups` or the user's home directory.

The user is the person issuing the print job.  If both, the cups
server (having the SeedDMS backend installed) and the client run on
the same computer, the user will be an existent user on the system and
the backend can easily access the user's home directory and read the
configuration file. But if the client runs on a different computer,
the user is likely to be somebody not available on the cups server.
Actually, if the client is for example a mobile phone, the user name
is often just be set to the model name of the phone. Unfortunately,
this name cannot be changed.  So, printing from your 'Redmi Note 8T'
will set the user to 'Redmi Note 8T', but other phones may have more
cryptic model names. In any of those cases the backend will not find
the user's home directory (unless there is by accident a user with
that unusual name) and therefore will read the system wide
configuration.  Since version 0.0.2 the path of the configuration file
can also be user dependent in
`/etc/seeddms-cups/<username>/printers.yaml`.  Needless to say, that
this way of choosing the configuration can be quite dangerous and may
enable users to upload documents into SeedDMS which are not allowed
to. Hence, always check the uploaded documents in SeedDMS before
processing them any further.

This configuration file may contain several sections. Each for a
configured printer in cups. If none of the section names match the
printer name, the `default` section will be used.

Each section must at least define the parameters:

  * `Url` (URL of REST API)
  * `ApiKey` or `User` and `Password`
  * `FolderId` (Id of folder to store printed documents)
  * `LogLevel` (set to `debug` for more verbose logging)

Example:

    default:
      Url: http://your-seeddms-host/restapi/index.php
      ApiKey: your-secret-key
      FolderId: 1
      LogLevel: debug
   
There is an example configuration `seeddms-cups.yaml`. Copy it into one
of the possible locations on your server and adjust it to your needs.

Keep in mind, that the configuration file contains an API key which
may not be readable by ordinary user. Change the file mode of the
configuration to `600`.

   chmod 600 /etc/seeddms-cups/printers.yaml

## Pitfalls

Systems having AppArmor installed may prevent calling the backend
because it request access on files not allowed for `/usr/sbin/cupsd`.
Check your system messages with `dmesg`. If it contains lines like

   [39772.258276] audit: type=1400 audit(1709830581.956:9349): apparmor="DENIED" operation="open" class="file" profile="/usr/sbin/cupsd" name="/proc/241961/cgroup" pid=241961 comm="cupsd" requested_mask="r" denied_mask="r" fsuid=0 ouid=0

If it does, then AppArmor blocks the execution of the backend script.
On Debian the above example will require to add a line

@{PROC}/*/cgroup r,

to your `/etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.cupsd`. There are already similar lines, but
none of them allows read access on `/proc/<number>/cgroup`

## Debugging

This cups backend logs many useful information to the sys logger. If the
log level is set to `debug` it will also log the environment variables, which
contain most of the relevant data for the backend. On recent debian systems (>= 12)
just run 

     journalctl -f -u cups

to monitor the execution of the backend. If syslog is still saved to a file
in `/var/log/syslog` then run

     tail -f /var/log/syslog
